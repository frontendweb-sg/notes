# What are PWA (progressive web apps)?

Progressive web apps (PWAs) are founded on the idea that web applications should have an app-like experience.

**`Benefits of PWAs`**

- Install locally
- Works without internet
- Widely available
- Offile storage
- Push notification

**There are three primary benefits:**

**Ability to install it locally:**

Web apps used to be limited to users remembering the URL or bookmarking it, but now users can add your app to their mobile device’s home screen like any other app.

**Users can use your app offline:**

Web apps also used to be bound by whether a user was connected to the internet, but with PWAs, this is no longer a limitation.

**Ease of access:**

As long as users have a modern browser, they are able to install your app without being restricted by the app store marketplace.

**`Drawbacks of PWAs`**

It’s essential to understand that they are not replacements for natively built apps

- Not a replacement of IOS and Android support
- Not a real native app
- No bluetooth
- NFC
- High storage capacity

`Note:`
features like PWA push notifications work on `Android` but are not supported on `iOS`.
