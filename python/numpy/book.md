# NumPy

`NumPy` is the fundamental package for `scientific` computing in Python.
It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices)

`Numpy` (Numerical Python) is an open source `python` library that's widely used in `science` and `engineering`.

`Numpy` contains multidimentional `array` data structures, such as `homogeneous`, `N-dimentional (ndarray)` and a large library of functions
that operate efficiently on these data structures.

- `NumPy` arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically).
  Changing the size of an `ndarray` will create a new array and delete the original.

- The elements in a `NumPy` array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory.

- `NumPy` arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data.

- A growing `plethora` of scientific and mathematical Python-based packages are using `NumPy` arrays;
