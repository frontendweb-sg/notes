# Networking

Networking is a fundamental aspect of Linux system administration.

**`Basic concepts:`**

`IP Address:`

An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network. There are two types:

- `IPv4:` 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- `IPv6:` 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

`MAC Address:`

A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a hardware identifier for network interfaces, usually represented as a series of six pairs of hexadecimal digits` (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)`.

`Subnet Mask:`

A subnet mask separates the IP address into the network and host portions (e.g., 255.255.255.0).

`Gateway:`

A gateway is a device that routes traffic from a local network to other networks, often serving as the default route for outgoing traffic.

`DNS:`

Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses.

**`Network Configuration Files:`**

```sh
# /etc/network/interfaces
```
